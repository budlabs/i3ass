# readme_usage

There is no oneline way to describe what **i3ass** does.
And some of the scripts are rather complex,
To get an idea I suggest taking a look in the [wiki]
or the individual readme files for each script (linked in the table below).

|**file**  |     **function**          |
|:---------|:--------------------------|
|[i3flip] | Tabswitching done right
|[i3fyra] | An advanced, simple grid-based tiling layout
|[i3get] | Boilerplate and template maker for bash scripts
|[i3gw] | a ghost window wrapper for i3wm
|[i3Kornhe] | move and resize windows gracefully
|[i3list] | list information about the current i3 session.
|[i3menu] | Adds more features to rofi when used in i3wm
|[i3run] | Run, Raise or hide windows in i3wm
