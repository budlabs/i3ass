i3Kornhe provides an alternative way to move and resize
windows in **i3**. It has some more functions then the
defaults and is more streamlined. Resizing floating windows
is done by first selecting a corner of the window,  and then
moving that corner. See the wiki or the manpage for details
and how to add the required mode in the i3 config file that
is needed to use **i3Kornhe**.
