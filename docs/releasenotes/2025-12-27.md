##  i3fyra --mono 
Monocle mode toggle. If used on i3fyra workspace
will make currently focused fyra container the only visible.
If it already is the only visible, this command will show
the other containers. This includes some smart logic, so
it remembers which windows where hidden, so toggling back and forth
works smooth.

If window is not on i3fyra workspace, this command will toggle fullscreen.

## i3fyra --rotate family|sibling
swaps place of families or siblings with one command.
To achieve this before you needed to first hide the target
then show it on the opposite direction (that still works btw)

## i3fyra --orientation
Now supports `toggle` argument
