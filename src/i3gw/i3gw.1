\fB\fCi3gw MARK\fR

.SH USAGE
.PP
\fB\fCi3-msg\fR has an undocumented function: \fIopen\fP,
it creates empty containers,
or as I call them: ghosts.
Since these empty containers doesn't contain any windows
there is no instance/class/title to identify them,
making it difficult to manage them.
They do however have a \fB\fCcon_id\fR
and I found that the easiest way to keep track of ghosts, is to mark them.
That is what this script does,
it creates a ghost,
get its \fB\fCcon_id\fR and marks it.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fB\fC$ i3gw casper\fR

.PP
this will create a ghost marked casper,
you can perform any action you can perform on a regular container.

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] move to workspace 2
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] split v
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] layout tabbed
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] kill

.fi
.RE

.PP
the last command (\fB\fCkill\fR), destroys the container.
