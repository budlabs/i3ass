.SH NAME
i3gw \- a ghost window wrapper for i3wm

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBi3gw MARK\fR

.SH OPTIONS
.EX
-h, --help     | print help and exit  
--verbose      | short description  
-v, --version  | print messages to stderr  
.EE

.SH USAGE
\fBi3-msg\fR has an undocumented function: \fIopen\fP,
it creates empty containers,
or as I call them: ghosts.
Since these empty containers doesn't contain any windows
there is no instance/class/title to identify them,
making it difficult to manage them.
They do however have a \fBcon_id\fR
and I found that the easiest way to keep track of ghosts, is to mark them.
That is what this script does,
it creates a ghost,
get its \fBcon_id\fR and marks it.

.SH EXAMPLES
\fB$ i3gw casper\fR

.PP
this will create a ghost marked casper,
you can perform any action you can perform on a regular container.

.EX
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] move to workspace 2
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] split v
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] layout tabbed
$ i3-msg [con_mark=casper] kill
.EE

.PP
the last command (\fBkill\fR), destroys the container.
